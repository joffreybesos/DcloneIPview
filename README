# DClone IP view

This is a simple tool to find the IP of your current Diablo 2 session.  
It will display the currently connected IP in your choice of top right, top left, bottom left, bottom right of your screen.

I have created this as a separate tool to my Map Hack https://github.com/joffreybesos/d2r-mapview  
This script requires admin privileges and if I added to my MH then it also would require admin privileges.

## How to run

You can install [Autohotkey](www.autohotkey.com) which is a free Windows shortcut tool.  
Then you double click `showIP.ahk`  
A green icon will appear in your system tray which you can right click to exit.  

The script will ask for administrator privileges, this is because Admin is required to get which PIDs are using which network connections.

Not tested on Windows 11

## Configure

In the `settings.ini` you can change the following:

| Setting |     Default     |    Description    |
| :-------------- | :------------------ | :---------------------- |
| position | TOP_RIGHT | Position on the screen. You can choose `TOP_LEFT`, `TOP_RIGHT`, `BOTTOM_LEFT` or `BOTTOM_RIGHT` |
| vertPadding | 20 | How many pixels to move the text from the top or bottom of the screen |
| horizPadding | 20 | How many pixels to move the text from the left or right side of the screen |
| windowTitle | Diablo II: Resurrected | Only change this if you run multiple instances. It will tell the script which game session to examine. If you have 2 sessions run 2 copies of this script, each with their own settings.ini |
